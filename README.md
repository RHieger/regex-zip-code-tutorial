# Tutorial on Regular Expressions&mdash;Validating Zip Codes

This repository contains all development for a tutorial that will be
published on Medium.com under JavaScript in Plain English.

As project has progressed, I determined that the tutorial needed to be broken into three parts due to complexity and breadth of content.

The three parts of the tutorial are:

1. [Regular Expressions&nmdash;a Rite of Passage for Web Developers](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/regular-expressions-a-rite-of-passage-for-web-developers-b24181465096)<br /><br />
2. [Regular Expressions&mndash;a Rite of Passage: From Theory to Practice](https://rhieger-98255.medium.com/regular-expressions-a-rite-of-passage-from-theory-to-practice-f4f23bec6044)<br /><br />
3. [Regular Expressions&mdash;a Rite of Passage: Completing the Application](https://rhieger-98255.medium.com/regular-expressions-a-rite-of-passage-completing-the-application-526589605075)
