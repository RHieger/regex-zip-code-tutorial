# Tutorial on Regular Expressionsâ€”Zip Code Example

This repository contains all development for a tutorial that will be
published on Medium.com under JavaScript in Plain English.

As project has progressed, I determined that the tutorial needed to be broken into three parts due to complexity and breadth of content.

As of May 22, 2022, **Part 1** and **Part 2** have been published. **Part 2** will neeed re-writes as new bugs have emerged in the finished code and must be addressed before I can complete **Part 3** of the tutorial.
