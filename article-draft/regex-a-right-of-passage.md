##### Intended Audience: Intermediate Developers

## Introduction

The entire software engineering profession, regardless of discipline, eventually
faces a challenge along the learning pathway. When a budding or even an experienced
developer encounters this challenge, it presents as somewhat of a monolithic barrier.

It is almost as if that moment is the discovery of a new and threatening four letter word&mdash;**regex.** This despite the fact that the word is five letters.

Speaking for myself, when I first encountered **regex,** or **regular expressions**
as they are also known, my experience was a disheartening struggle to learn what
seemed a mysterious language that, despite its obvious strength, whose utility was
not at all obvious.

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a working demo web application that will
search out and display valid zip codes extracted from a test string including
characters that in no way comprise a valid zipcode.

But first, let's dive a bit into what regular expressions are.

### What are Regular Expressions?

In a nutshell, what are regular expressions, and what do they do? Well, this is a
complex question that is somewhat difficult to answer simply. Perhaps a brief
historic perspective on this seemingly arcane language would help to clarify what
it is, and even more importantly, what it is capable of doing.

#### The Origin of Regular Expressions

Regular expressions have their roots in a 1951 paper by mathemtician Stephen Cole Kleene
entitled **_Representation of Events in Nerve Nets and Finite Automata._** The ideas
explored in this paper led to exploration of means to match patterns of characters 

The theories defined in this paper are far beyond the scope of this tutorial, but should
you be interested in exploring this theory, you can download the paper

Practical application of Kleene's theories came into their own around 1968
