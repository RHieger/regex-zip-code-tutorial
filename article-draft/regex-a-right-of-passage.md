##### Intended Audience: Intermediate Developers

## Introduction

The entire software engineering profession, regardless of discipline, eventually
faces a challenge along the learning pathway. When a budding or even an experienced
developer encounters this challenge, it presents as somewhat of a monolithic barrier.

It is almost as if that moment is the discovery of a new and threatening four letter word&mdash;**regex.** This despite the fact that the word is five letters.

Speaking for myself, when I first encountered **regex,** or **regular expressions**
as they are also known, my experience was a disheartening struggle to learn what
seemed a mysterious language that, despite its obvious strength, whose utility was
not at all obvious.

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a working demo web application that will
search out and display valid zip codes extracted from a test string including
characters that in no way comprise a valid zipcode.

But first, let's dive a bit into what regular expressions are.

### What are Regular Expressions?

In a nutshell, what are regular expressions, and what do they do? Well, this is a
complex question that is somewhat difficult to answer simply. Perhaps a brief
historic perspective on this seemingly arcane language would help to clarify what
it is, and even more importantly, what it is capable of doing.

#### The Origin of Regular Expressions

Regular expressions had their start in theories put forth in 1951 by mathematician
Stephen Cole Kleene. He defined what he called a regular language described using
a mathematical notation he called **regular events.**
